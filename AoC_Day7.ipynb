{"cells": [{"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "# AoC Day 7 2023 - Part 1\nBecause the journey will take a few days, she offers to teach you the game of Camel Cards. Camel Cards is sort of similar to poker except it's designed to be easier to play while riding a camel.\n\nIn Camel Cards, you get a list of hands, and your goal is to order them based on the strength of each hand. A hand consists of five cards labeled one of A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. The relative strength of each card follows this order, where A is the highest and 2 is the lowest.\n\nEvery hand is exactly one type. From strongest to weakest, they are:\n\nFive of a kind, where all five cards have the same label: AAAAA\nFour of a kind, where four cards have the same label and one card has a different label: AA8AA\nFull house, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards share a different label: 23332\nThree of a kind, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards are each different from any other card in the hand: TTT98\nTwo pair, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second label, and the remaining card has a third label: 23432\nOne pair, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a different label from the pair and each other: A23A4\nHigh card, where all cards' labels are distinct: 23456\nHands are primarily ordered based on type; for example, every full house is stronger than any three of a kind.\n\nIf two hands have the same type, a second ordering rule takes effect. Start by comparing the first card in each hand. If these cards are different, the hand with the stronger first card is considered stronger. If the first card in each hand have the same label, however, then move on to considering the second card in each hand. If they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins; otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then the fifth.\n\nSo, 33332 and 2AAAA are both four of a kind hands, but 33332 is stronger because its first card is stronger. Similarly, 77888 and 77788 are both a full house, but 77888 is stronger because its third card is stronger (and both hands have the same first and second card).\n\nTo play Camel Cards, you are given a list of hands and their corresponding bid (your puzzle input). For example:\n\n32T3K 765\nT55J5 684\nKK677 28\nKTJJT 220\nQQQJA 483\nThis example shows five hands; each hand is followed by its bid amount. Each hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its rank, where the weakest hand gets rank 1, the second-weakest hand gets rank 2, and so on up to the strongest hand. Because there are five hands in this example, the strongest hand will have rank 5 and its bid will be multiplied by 5.\n\nSo, the first step is to put the hands in order of strength:\n\n32T3K is the only one pair and the other hands are all a stronger type, so it gets rank 1.\nKK677 and KTJJT are both two pair. Their first cards both have the same label, but the second card of KK677 is stronger (K vs T), so KTJJT gets rank 2 and KK677 gets rank 3.\nT55J5 and QQQJA are both three of a kind. QQQJA has a stronger first card, so it gets rank 5 and T55J5 gets rank 4.\nNow, you can determine the total winnings of this set of hands by adding up the result of multiplying each hand's bid with its rank (765 * 1 + 220 * 2 + 28 * 3 + 684 * 4 + 483 * 5). So the total winnings in this example are 6440.\n\nFind the rank of every hand in your set. What are the total winnings?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Prompt**\n\nWelcome to solve AoC 2023 Day 7 Part 1 with me. Is there a way to encode the different hands such that from their value the rank is clear?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Response**\n\nLet's think about how to encode the hands in a way that makes ranking straightforward. We need two key pieces of information for each hand:\n\n1. The type of hand (Five of a kind, Four of a kind, etc.)\n2. The card values in order for tie-breaking\n\nFor card values, we could map each card to a number, where:\nA -> 14, K -> 13, Q -> 12, J -> 11, T -> 10, and numbers stay as they are.\n\nFor hand types, we could similarly assign values from 7 to 1:\n- Five of a kind -> 7\n- Four of a kind -> 6\n- Full house -> 5\n- Three of a kind -> 4\n- Two pair -> 3\n- One pair -> 2\n- High card -> 1\n\nWould you like to explore how we might combine these into a single value that would make sorting hands straightforward?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Prompt**\n\nYes"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Response**\n\nSince we need the hand type to be the most significant part of our value (it should always win over card values), we could multiply the hand type by a large enough number and then add the card values.\n\nFor example, if we multiply the hand type by 15^5 (since 15 is larger than our highest card value of 14), that would ensure the hand type always dominates.\n\nThen we could multiply each card by decreasing powers of 15 based on its position.\n\nSo for a hand, the formula might look like:\n```\nvalue = (hand_type * 15^5) + (card1 * 15^4) + (card2 * 15^3) + (card3 * 15^2) + (card4 * 15^1) + card5\n```\n\nWould you like to try this with an example hand to see how it works?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Prompt**\n\nIs it sensible to keep these encoding-maps as dictionaries?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Response**\n\nYes, using dictionaries would be a clean way to handle these mappings!
