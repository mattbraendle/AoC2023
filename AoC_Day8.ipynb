Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!\nAfter examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: AAA and ZZZ. You feel like AAA is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right instructions until you reach ZZZ.\nThis format defines each node of the network individually. For example:\n\n```\nRL\n\nAAA = (BBB, CCC)\nBBB = (DDD, EEE)\nCCC = (ZZZ, GGG)\nDDD = (DDD, DDD)\nEEE = (EEE, EEE)\nGGG = (GGG, GGG)\nZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\n```\n\nStarting with AAA, you need to look up the next element based on the next left/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with AAA and go right (R) by choosing the right element of AAA, CCC. Then, L means to choose the left element of CCC, ZZZ. By following the left/right instructions, you reach ZZZ in 2 steps.\n\nOf course, you might not find ZZZ right away. If you run out of left/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: RL really means RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL... and so on. For example, here is a situation that takes 6 steps to reach ZZZ:\n\n```\nLLR\n\nAAA = (BBB, BBB)\nBBB = (AAA, ZZZ)\nZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\n```\nStarting at AAA, follow the left/right instructions.

Only one way to find out.\n\nAfter examining the maps a bit longer, your attention is drawn to a curious fact: the number of nodes with names ending in A is equal to the number ending in Z! If you were a ghost, you'd probably just start at every node that ends with A and follow all of the paths at the same time until they all simultaneously end up at nodes that end with Z.\n\nFor example:\n```\nLR\n\n11A = (11B, XXX)\n11B = (XXX, 11Z)\n11Z = (11B, XXX)\n22A = (22B, XXX)\n22B = (22C, 22C)\n22C = (22Z, 22Z)\n22Z = (22B, 22B)\nXXX = (XXX, XXX)\n```\nHere, there are two starting nodes, 11A and 22A (because they both end with A). As you follow each left/right instruction, use that instruction to simultaneously navigate away from both nodes you're currently on. Repeat this process until all of the nodes you're currently on end with Z. (If only some of the nodes you're on end with Z, they act like any other node and you continue as normal.) In this example, you would proceed as follows:\n\nStep 0: You are at 11A and 22A.\nStep 1: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22B.\nStep 2: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22C.\nStep 3: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22Z.\nStep 4: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22B.\nStep 5: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22C.\nStep 6: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22Z.\nSo, in this example, you end up entirely on nodes that end in Z after 6 steps.\n\nSimultaneously start on every node that ends with A.

The number 12357789728873 should be the correct answer for Part 2. \n\nHere's why this works:\n1. Each path takes a certain number of steps to reach a 'Z' node (the numbers we found: [24253, 21797, 14429, 16271, 20569, 13201])\n2. The LCM gives us the smallest number that's divisible by all these numbers\n3.

Or would you like to understand more about why the LCM gives us the right answer?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Prompt**\n\nYou are right, it is correct, but I still do not get it. IS this network special that each individual path until the first 'Z' is a cycle?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Response**\n\nActually, I made an assumption earlier that wasn't fully explained. Let's investigate this:\n\nWould you like to modify your code to see what happens AFTER reaching the first 'Z' node for one path? We could:\n1. Pick one starting node (say 'AAA')\n2. Track the sequence of nodes it visits\n3. Continue past the first 'Z' for several more steps\n4. Print out this sequence to see if/how it cycles\n\nThis would help us understand if the paths are actually cycling, and if so, how. Would you like to try this to verify our assumption about the cycling behavior?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Prompt**\n\nI want to understand why they cycle, it seems obvious that they do, otherwise the solution would not work? Why do they cycle in the given network?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Response**\n\nAh, let's break down why these paths MUST cycle in this network:\n\n1. The network is finite (has a limited number of nodes)\n2. The instruction sequence is fixed and repeats (your L/R sequence)\n3. At each node, the choices are deterministic:\n   - For 'L', you always go to the same left node\n   - For 'R', you always go to the same right node\n4. Most importantly: When you're at any node with a specific position in the instruction sequence, your next move is completely determined\n\nThis means that if you ever hit the same node at the same position in the instruction sequence, you MUST follow the exact same path afterward. And since:\n- There are only a finite number of nodes\n- And a finite instruction sequence\n- You must eventually hit a combination you've seen before\n\nWould you like to verify this by tracking both the nodes AND the instruction position to see when the cycle starts?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Prompt**\n\nI get it that is must eventually cycle but each path with the individual lengths given in nr_steps need not be cycles, right. But if they are not cycles, then LCM should not work."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Response**\n\nAh, now I understand your question better! You're right - just knowing that paths eventually cycle isn't enough. For the LCM solution to work, we need an additional property:\n\nFor each starting node ending in 'A':\n1. The number of steps to first reach 'Z' must be the same as the cycle length\n2. After reaching 'Z', it must immediately start the same cycle again\n\nLet's verify this! Would you like to modify the code to check for one path:\n1. How many steps to first 'Z'\n2. How many steps from that 'Z' to the next 'Z'\n3. Whether these numbers are the same\n\nThis would help us understand if the input was specially constructed to have this property. Would you like to check this?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Prompt**\n\nYes it has this property, otherwise the solution would not work, bit that makes the network have a special property which is nowhere stated in the problem?"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "**AI Response**\n\nExactly! You've identified something very important - this puzzle relies on a \"hidden\" property of the input data that isn't mentioned in the problem description. The network was specially constructed so that:\n\n1. Each path from an 'A' node to its first 'Z' node is exactly one cycle length\n2. These cycles are \"clean\" - they start over immediately after reaching Z\n\nThis is what makes the LCM solution work, but it's not a property that would be true for any arbitrary network of nodes with the same rules. It's a case where understanding the actual input data's special properties was key to finding the solution.\n\nWould you like to see what would happen in a network that didn't have this special property?

Computing LCM (built-in Python function)\n\nThe only potential optimization might be combining steps 1 and 2 into a single pass through the input, but that would make the code less readable and wouldn't significantly improve performance.\n\nThe solution relies on the special property of the input (that paths form perfect cycles from first Z), which allows us to use LCM.
